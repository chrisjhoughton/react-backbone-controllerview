# React-Backbone Controller View

A simple mixin to bind Backbone models and collections to React components.

This "controller view" aims to do four things:

* Embrace uni-directional data flow
* Provide a simple declarative approach
* Let you write less code
* Allow for view control

## Installation & quick start

### 1. Install the mixin:

```
npm install rb-controllerview
```

### 2. Add the mixin to your components

```js
var React          = require('react');
var ControllerView = require('rb-controllerview');

var MyComponent = React.createClass({
  
  mixins: [ ControllerView ],

  // Declare any models in the view - any models will get set to state
  // by calling `toJSON()` internally.
  // (This is run before mount)
  getModels: function () {
    return {
      user: new Backbone.Model({ name: 'Chris Houghton '})
    };
  },

  render: function () {
    return (
      <div>
        Hey there, my name is {this.state.user.name}.
      </div>
    );
  }

});
```

### 3. Updates automatically happen

Whenever the model updates, the `state` will automatically be updated, resulting
in the desired UI updates.





## Inspiration 

React's concept of uni-directional data flow is fantastic. It adds simplicity to applications, 
making it simple to understand and debug.

When integrating Backbone with React, there's a few key challenges & questions:

1. How can I ensure that views update when the model/collection changes?
2. Is it possible to avoid writing `on('change')` and `on('sync')` all over the place?
3. Just which component "owns" the data?

There's a few possible options, such as:

|                                              Option                                             |                                                                                                                               The good & the bad                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Passing the model directly as a `prop`, and using a parent controller around each component. | Sounds simple, it isn't. The component won't automatically hook into model updates and update the views, so you'll need `forceUpdate` (bad). Also, if the model is passed to child components, anyone in the hierarchy can update the data, whic breaks uni-directional flow. |
| 2. Declaring the model directly as a property of the component.                                 | This is cleaner, you'll usually declare the model within `componentWillMount`. There's still all the same issues as above though.                                                                                                                                             |
| 3. Set the model's full data to state, and __never__ pass the model to children.                | Cleaner as well. Also, by setting all data to state, React will automatically update components. The component that "owns" the model can make the updates, if the children need to, then can do so by passing functions as `props`. (Fits with React uni-directional flow)    |

This mixin goes for the third option:

* Models & collections are declared internally within the component
* All data from models and collections are set to `state`
* Updates/syncs automatically cause the `state` to update (but they don't _have_ to)

The term "controller-view" was inspired by [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html), where one React component
controls the data flow, and acts as the glue between the data models and the UI.

To answer the question:

> "Where should the controller view live in the hierarchy?" 

It's actually better to ask the question:

> "Where should the __state__ live in the hierarchy?"

And to answer _this_ question, read [this part of "Thinking in React"](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html#step-4-identify-where-your-state-should-live).


## Usage 

You'll need to declare `ControllerView` as a mixin in the React component you'd like to act as a 
controller-view, and then declare your Backbone models and collections using `getModels` and `getCollections`.

For example, you might have a page where you can see a list of [skittles](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=skittles&es_sm=119&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAWoVChMI-PDx0_T7yAIVhG4UCh1iawus&biw=1280&bih=701) that a user owns:

```js
var $              = require('jquery');
var React          = require('react');
var ControllerView = require('rb-controllerview');
var user           = require('models/user'); // instance, not class
var skittles       = require('collections/skittles'); // instance, not class

var UserSkittles = React.createClass({  

  mixins: [ ControllerView ],

  getInitialState: function () {
    return {
      isLoading: true
    };
  },

  getModels: function () {
    return {
      user: user({ id: this.props.id });
    };
  },

  getCollections: function () {
    return {
      skittles: skittles([], { user_id: this.props.id });
    };
  },

  render: function () {
    var skittles = this.state.skittles.map(function (skittle) {
      return <li key={skittle.id}>{skittle.color}</li>
    });

    return (
      <div>
        {this.state.user.name+"'s"} skittles:

        <ul>
          {skittles}
        </ul>
      </div>
    );
  }

});

module.exports = UserSkittles;
```
