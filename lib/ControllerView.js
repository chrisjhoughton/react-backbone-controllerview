/*
* The controller view mixin is specifically designed to help react views
* work more closely with Backbone. The views that use this should be "controller-views",
* views that are more about controlling an overall application than
* rendering an individual component of it.
*
* Importantly, controller views are the only ones with access to Backbone
* models/collections. They take the contents as `state`, and then pass
* it down to child components as props.
*
* When a Backbone model/collection updates, the state automatically updates
* unless explicitly specified in the controller-view.
